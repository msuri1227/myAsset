@protocol SAML2WebStrategy <NSObject>

/**
 Starts the SAML2 authentication by opening the finish endpoint URL. This initiates a communication to the Service Provider (SP)
 which in turn is expected to respond with a SAML2 challenge that will redirect the user to the Identity Provider (IdP). After
 authentication the SP is expected to perform a redirect on the finish endpoint with an URL parameter called the finish endpoint
 param. When this redirect happens the SAML2 flow is considered to be complete.
 <p>
 Implementations are expected to open the specified finish endpoint as a web page and close it when the final redirect happens.
 Furthermore, the specified callback <b>must</b> be invoked otherwise the pending HTTP request(s) waiting for it to complete might
 be held up indefinitely.
 </p>
 <p>
 It is guaranteed that within the application only one method of this type is executing at a given time. This is because strategies are
 shared across conversation managers.
 </p>
 <p>
 Use the methods of the <code>SAML2WebStrategyHelper</code> for steps common to all implementations. Read its API documentation for
 the details.
