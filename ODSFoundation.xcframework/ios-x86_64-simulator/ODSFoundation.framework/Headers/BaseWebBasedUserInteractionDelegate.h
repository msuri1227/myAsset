/**
 Abstract base class for delegates of the <code>WebBasedUserInteractionViewController</code> class. Subclasses should implement the
 methods of the web view delegate protocol to follow how's the user interaction going in the web view. Typically, implementations make
 use of the <code>WKwebView:decidePolicyForNavigationAction:decisionHandler:</code> method to detect certain page loads events and react accordingly.
 <p>
 By convention, implementations decide when a particular interaction running in a web view is considered running, complete or cancelled. If
 the interaction has finished then either the <code>completeWithResult:</code> or the <code>cancel</code> method should be invoked to
 finish the interaction. After that no other calls are going to be made to this object.
 </p>
 <p>
 An implementation may also restart the web-based interaction by calling the <code>restartWithURL:</code> method.
 </p>
 <p>
 An actual instance of this type is instantiated usually by the <code>createInteractionForRequest:completion:</code> method of a
 <code>UserInteractionHandlerProtocol</code> implementation. Then, the instance is passed to the initializer of a <code>WebBasedUserInteractionViewController</code>
 and then the controller is returned as part of the <code>UserInteractionDescriptor</code> to drive the interaction.
 </p>
 <p>
 This class is not thread-safe but if the protected methods are invoked only from within the <code>WKNavigationDelegate</code> methods then no thread-safety
 issues should arise. If a subclass implements a logic that may involve the usage of other threads then it must properly synchronise these calls.
 </p>
