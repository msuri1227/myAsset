/**
 This class represents a shared storage among application intended for storing <code>SecIdentityRef</code> objects (i.e, typically
 certificates). A particular identity may be stored for a given string key.
 <p>
 Under the hood, the Keychain Services API is used to create a so-called <i>shared keychain</i> which may be shared among multiple apps.
 Make sure to read the relevant Apple documentation as to what is required to set this up properly. In short: all participating applications
 must be signed with the same developer certificate and should add the <code>federationEntitlements</code> entitlement to the application
 bundle.
 </p>
 <p>
 This class works only on a real device. To obtain an instance of this type use either the <code>createWithPasscode:error:</code> or the
 <code>openWithPasscode:error:</code> methods. Trying to acquire more than one object of this type is not recommended and the behaviour
 is undefined.
 </p>
 <p>
 This class is not thread-safe.
