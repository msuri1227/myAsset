/**
 Observer protocol using which HTTP redirections can be observed which occur during the conversations fired by a particular
 <code>HttpConversationManager</code>. It is different from the <code>URLSession:task:willPerformHTTPRedirection:newRequest:completionHandler</code> delegate method
 that this object gets called when the final decision about a particular redirection has been made by the delegate and/or the conversation manager
 (i.e. by redirect filters).

 Invoked when a redirection happens in the given task which leads to the specified URL. The task is guaranteed to belong to a conversation whose ID
 is accessible using the <code>conversationId</code> property defined by the library-specific<code>HttpConversation</code> category of the

 <p>
 This method is not invoked if the redirection is swallowed, that is, the response with the 3xx status code is returned verbatim as any other HTTP response.
