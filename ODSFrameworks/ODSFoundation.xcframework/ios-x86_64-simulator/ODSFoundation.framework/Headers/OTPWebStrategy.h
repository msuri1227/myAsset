/**
 Protocol defining the strategy how to open the URL that leads to the OTP authentication screen.
 */
@protocol OTPWebStrategy <NSObject>

/**
 Starts the OTP authentication using the specified arguments. As the OTP flow has certain steps that are implementation-independent,
 implementors are expected to make use of the <code>OTPWebStrategyHelper</code> class. Below are the steps what make up the flow:
 <ol>
 <li>The strategy should open the specified URL in one way or the other. It is assumed to be obtained from an OTP challenge which
 is actually an HTTP redirect. The URL points to the OTP login form.</li>
 <li>After the form has been opened the implementor must monitor when the web flow attempts to open the SAP Authenticator application
 using the <code>[OTPWebStrategyHelper extractPasscodeParameterNameFrom:]</code> method.</li>
 <li>At this point the user should be interacting with the SAP Authenticator application the end result of which is the passcode.
 It might happen that the SAP Authenticator is opened and the passcode is fetched in a different way (for ex. via copy-pasting it
 from the SAP Authenticator app without opening it with a link). If that is the case then these steps are missing.</li>
 <li>When the SAP Authenticator returns the passcode to the application, it does so by opening an URL with the <code>&lt;app.
 bundle ID&gt;.xcallbackurl</code> scheme. This application must have this scheme registered in the <code>Info.plist</code> file
 appropriately. The easiest way to use this is to follow the guidance of the <code>CustomURLSchemeManager</code> class of this
 library. The goal is to extract the passcode from this callback URL using the
 <code>[OTPWebStrategyHelper extractPasscodeFrom:withParameterName:</code></li> method.
 <li>If the one-time passcode is at hand then the OTP form should be reloaded. Use the
 <code>[OTPWebStrategyHelper createOTPFormURLFrom:withPasscode:]</code> method to get this URL.</li>
 <li>The strategy implementation then should load this URL and then wait for a request which contains the finish endpoint. To
 achieve this, use the <code>[OTPWebStrategyHelper isClosingRedirect:withFinishEndpoint:]</code> method and complete the flow if it returns true.
 Note that in case the user manually copy-pastes the passcode into the OTP form then this is the only step in the process as no
 custom-URL-scheme-driven mechanisns are going to be used to communicate between this application and the SAP Authenticator.</li>
 </ol>
 <p>
 As can be seen, implementations are required to follow quite a strict pattern in order to comply with the contracts of this protocol.
 This is because the OTP flow supported is very strongly tied to web-based flows. Consequently, implementations usually differ based
 on how they implement the web flow. The default implementation, for example, makes use of the built-in <code>WKWebView</code> and the
 <code>UserInteractionMultiplexer</code> library. Possible implementations could be using different web view implementations or other means
 to display the OTP form and implement the flow.
