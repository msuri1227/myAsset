/**
 Immutable value object used as the interaction request object for commencing SAML2 authentication. To comply with the
 contracts of the <code>UserInteractionMultiplexer</code> library, this class implements the <code>isEqual:</code> method
 which returns true if an object of this type is compared with another object having the same type and equal properties.
 <p>
 This equality will ensure that when multiple HTTP requests run into the SAML2 challenge then only one web view is going to
 be displayed for all of them, provided that all the SAML2 configuration parameters and the token are the same.
 </p>
 <p>
 An object of this type is used by the default SAML2 web strategy.
